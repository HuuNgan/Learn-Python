#Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes
mystring = 'hello'
print(mystring)
mystring = "hello_again"
print(mystring)
#The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy
#to include apostrophes
#(whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes

mystring = "why don't you say hello me?"
print(mystring)
